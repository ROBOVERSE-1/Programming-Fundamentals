# Programming-Fundamentals-C++
Beginner-friendly C++ programs covering core programming concepts like variables, control structures, functions, arrays, pointers, file handling, and basic OOP. Perfect for students or anyone starting with C++ and looking to build strong programming fundamentals.
🔹 What You’ll Learn:
This repository covers a broad range of foundational topics in C++:

Basic Syntax – Learn how to write simple C++ programs, use comments, and understand the structure of a C++ project.

Data Types & Variables – Explore different data types, how variables are declared and initialized, and how type conversion works.

Input/Output – Master standard I/O operations using cin, cout, and formatting output.

Control Structures – Use conditional statements (if, switch) and loops (for, while, do-while) for decision making and repetition.

Functions – Understand function declaration, definition, parameter passing, return types, and scope rules.

Arrays & Strings – Work with single and multi-dimensional arrays and basic string operations.

Pointers – Learn the basics of pointers, memory addresses, and pointer arithmetic.

File Handling – Perform file operations like reading from and writing to text files.

Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) – Get introduced to classes, objects, constructors, and access specifiers


🧠 Introduction to C++
C++ is a general-purpose, high-performance programming language created by Bjarne Stroustrup in 1979 at Bell Labs. It was developed as an extension of the C language with added Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) features.

It is often called the "middle-level" language because it supports both low-level programming (like C) and high-level abstraction (like Java).

🔍 Need for C++
✅ Why do we still use and learn C++?

🎮 For applications where speed and memory control are crucial.

🧰 To build system software like OS, drivers, and compilers.

📚 As a strong foundation for understanding programming logic.

🧱 It’s often used in competitive programming due to fast execution.
